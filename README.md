# HDT Lethal Finder Plugin

A plugin to see if you have lethal on board through taunts. Planning on expanding to all types of lethal, but one step at a time right?
Currently will display something on screen if there is lethal through taunt, w/o hero power consideration.

But I really have no idea what I'm doing. This is prob a little deep for a first project and I have no previous experience doing really any type of coding. Pls have some patience if you are waiting.
